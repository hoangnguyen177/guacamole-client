 About this README
------------------------------------------------------------

This README is intended to provide quick and to-the-point documentation for
technical users intending to compile parts of Guacamole themselves.

Distribution-specific packages are available from the files section of the main
project page:

 What is guacamole-auth-mysql?
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-ldap is a Java library for use with the Guacamole web
application to provide MySQL based authentication.

guacamole-auth-mysql provides an authentication provider which can be
set in guacamole.properties to allow MySQL authentication of Guacamole
users. Additional properties are required to configure the mysql
connection parameters.

A schema file are provided to create the required tables in your
mysql database.


------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling and installing guacamole-auth-mysql
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-mysql is built using Maven. Building guacamole-auth-mysql
compiles all classes and packages them into a redistributable .jar file. This
.jar file can be installed in the library directory configured in
guacamole.properties such that the authentication provider is available.

1) Run mvn package

    $ mvn package

    Maven will download any needed dependencies for building the .jar file.
    Once all dependencies have been downloaded, the .jar file will be
    created in the target/ subdirectory of the current directory.

4) Extract the .tar.gz file now present in the target/ directory, and
   place the .jar files in the extracted lib/ subdirectory in the library 
   directory specified in guacamole.properties.

    You will likely need to do this as root.

    If you do not have a library directory configured in your
    guacamole.properties, you will need to specify one. The directory
    is specified using the "lib-directory" property.

5) Set up your MySQL database to authenticate Guacamole users

    A schema file is provided in the schema directory for creating
    the guacamole authentication tables in your MySQL database.

    Additionally, a script is provided to create a default admin user
    with username 'guacadmin' and password 'guacadmin'. This user can 
    be used to set up any other connections and users.

6) Configure guacamole.properties for MySQL

    There are additional properties required by the MySQL JDBC driver
    which must be added/changed in your guacamole.properties:

    # Configuration for MySQL connection
    mysql-hostname:           mysql.host.name
    mysql-port:               3306
    mysql-database:           guacamole.database.name
    mysql-username:           user
    mysql-password:           pass

    Optionally, the authentication provider can be configured
    not to allow multiple users to use the same connection
    at the same time:

    mysql-disallow-simultaneous-connections: true
